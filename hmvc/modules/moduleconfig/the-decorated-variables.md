# The Decorated Variables

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/ModuleConfig.jpg)

At runtime, the configuration object will be created by ColdBox and decorated with the following private properties (available in the `variables` scope):

| Property      | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| appMapping    | The `appMapping` setting of the current host application                                                               |
| binder        | The WireBox configuration binder object                                                                                |
| cachebox      | A reference to CacheBox                                                                                                |
| controller    | A reference to the application's ColdBox Controller                                                                    |
| log           | A pre-configured LogBox Logger object for this specific class object (`coldbox.system.logging.Logger`)                 |
| logBox        | A Reference to LogBox                                                                                                  |
| moduleMapping | The `moduleMapping` setting of the current module. This is the path needed in order to instantiate CFCs in the module. |
| modulePath    | The absolute path to the current loading module                                                                        |
| wirebox       | A Reference to WireBox                                                                                                 |

You can use any of these private variables to create module settings, load CFCs, add binder mappings, etc.
