# Conventions

The core conventions delineate the contract between ColdBox and **you** for file/directory locations and more. Below is a table of the core conventions:

## Directory/File Conventions

* **config/Coldbox.cfc** - Your application configuration object (_optional_ )
* **config/Router.cfc** - Your application URL Router (_optional_ )
* **config/CacheBox.cfc** - Your application CacheBox configuration (_optional_ )
* **config/WireBox.cfc** - Your application WireBox Configuration (_optional_ )
* **handlers** - This holds the app's event handlers (controller layer)
* **layouts** - Your HTML layouts (view layer)
* **models** - This holds your app's CFCs  (model layer)
* **modules** - This holds the CommandBox tracked modules
* **modules\_app** - This holds your app's modules
* **tests** - Your test harness including unit and integration testing
* **views** - Your HTML views will go here (view layer)

## Execution Conventions

ColdBox also has several execution conventions.  This means that we have a convention or a default for the event, action and layout to be used if you do not tell it what to use:

| **Convention** | **Default Value**  | **Description**                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default Event  | `main.index`       | The default event to execute when no event is specified                           |
| Default Action | `index()`          | The default action to execute in an event handler controller if none is specified |
| Default Layout | `layouts/Main.cfm` | The default system layout to use                                                  |
