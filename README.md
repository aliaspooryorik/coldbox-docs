ColdBox [Hierarchical MVC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical\_model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)is the de-facto enterprise-level HMVC framework for ColdFusion (CFML) developers. It's professionally backed, conventions-based, modular, highly extensible, and productive. Getting started with ColdBox is quick and painless. ColdBox takes the pain out of development by giving you a standardized methodology for modern ColdFusion (CFML) development with features such as:

* [Conventions instead of configuration](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/conventions)
* [Modern routing engine](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/the-basics/routing)
* [RESTFul API ready](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/the-basics/event-handlers/rendering-data)
* [A hierarchical approach to MVC using ColdBox Modules](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/hmvc/modules)
* [Event-driven programming](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/digging-deeper/interceptors)
* [Async and Parallel programming constructs](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/digging-deeper/promises-async-programming)
* [Integration & Unit Testing](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/testing/testing-coldbox-applications)

* [Caching engine and API](https://cachebox.ortusbooks.com)
* [Logging engine](https://logbox.ortusbooks.com)
