# What's New With 6.4.0

ColdBox 6.4.0 is more of a major than a minor release due to the amount of work we have done to bring you one of the most revolutionary features of this framework: **Scheduled Tasks.** &#x20;

### ColdBox Scheduled Tasks

Scheduled tasks have always been a point of soreness for many developers in _ANY_ language.  Especially choosing where to place them for execution: should it be cron? windows task scheduler? ColdFusion engine? Jenkins, Gitlab? and the list goes on and on.

The _ColdBox Scheduled Tasks_ offers a fresh, programmatic and human approach to scheduling tasks on your server and multi-server application.  It allows you to define your tasks in a portable **Scheduler** we lovingly call the `Scheduler.cfc` which not only can be used to define your tasks, but also monitor all of their life-cycles and metrics of tasks.  Since ColdBox is also hierarchical, it allows for every single ColdBox Module to also define a `Scheduler` and register their own tasks as well.  This is a revolutionary approach to scheduling tasks in an HMVC application.

You can learn all about them in our two sections:
