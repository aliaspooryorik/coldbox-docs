# REST handler

## RestHander & ColdBox Response

Coldbox 6 has integrated a base handler and a response object into the core, so developers can have even more support when building RESTful services. This new rest handler will provide you with tons of utilities and approaches to make all of your RESTFul services:

* Uniform
* Consistent
* A consistent and extensible response object
* Error handling
* Invalid Route handling
* Much more

{% hint style="info" %}
In previous versions of ColdBox support for RESTful services was provided by adding base handler and the response object to our application templates. Integration into the core brings ease of use, faster handling and above all: a uniform approach for each ColdBox version in the future.

## Base Class: RestHandler

For creation of REST handlers you can inherit from our base class `coldbox.system.RestHandler`, directly via `extends="coldbox.system.Resthandler"` or our using the `restHandler` annotation.&#x20;

This will give you access to our enhanced API utilities and the native **response** object via the request context's `getResponse()` method.

```javascript
component extends="coldbox.system.RestHandler"{

  function index( event, rc, prc ){
    event.getResponse()
      .setData( "Hello from restful Land" );
  }
}

component resthandler{

  function index( event, rc, prc ){
    event.getResponse()
      .setData( "Hello from restful Land" );
  }

}
```

You will then leverage that response object to do the following actions:

* Set the data to be marshalled
* Set pagination data
* Set errors
* Set if the data is binary or not
* Set `location` headers
* Set message arrays
* Set `json` call backs
* Set `json` query formats
* Set response `contentType`
* Set response `statusCode`
* Set response `headers`
* Much More

{% hint style="info" %}
Upgrade notes: the response object will be accessible using the `event.getResponse()` method but will still be available as `prc.response.`

### Base Rest Handler Actions

The Rest handler gives you the following actions coded for you out of the box:

| **Core Actions**                               | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aroundHandler()`                              | Wraps all rest actions uniformly to provide consistency and error trapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `onError()`                                    | An implicit error handler is provided just in case anything explodes in your restful actions. Sends an appropriate 500 error                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `onValidationException()`                      | Traps any and makes sure it sends the appropriate 400 response with the invalid data. Useful for using **cbValidation**, for example with the `validateOrFail()` methods.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `onEntityNotFoundException()`                  | Traps any or exceptions and makes sure it send an appropriate 404 response. Useful for leveraging **cborm** or **Quick** ORM                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `onInvalidHTTPMethod()`                        | Traps any invalid HTTP method security exception and sends the appropriate 405 not allowed response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `onMissingAction()`                            | Traps any invalid actions/resource called in your application and sends the appropriate 404 response                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `onAuthenticationFailure()`                    | Traps `InvalidCredentials` exceptions and sends the appropriate 403 invalid credentials response. If you are using **cbSecurity** it will also verify jwt token expiration and change the error messages accordingly.                                                                                                              |
| `onAuthorizationFailure()`                     | Traps `PermissionDenied` exceptions and sends the appropriate 401 response.  This Action can be used when a user does not have authorization or access to your application or code. Usually you will call this manually or from a security library like **cbSecurity** or **cbGuard**. It will send a 401 not authorized response. |
| `onInvalidRoute()`                             | Action that can be used as a catch all from your router so it can catch all routes that are invalid. It will send a 404 response accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `onExpectationFailed()`                        | Utility method for when an expectation of the request fails ( e.g. an expected parameter is not provided ). This action is called manually from your own handlers and it will output a 417 response back to the user.                                                                                                              |
| <p></p><p><code>onAnyOtherException</code></p> | Fires when ANY exception that is not excplicitly trapped is detected.  This basically logs the issue and offers a 500 error.  You can now intercept it and do whatever you need on ANY type of untrapped exception.                                                                                                                |

### AroundHandler in Detail

The `aroundHandler`() provided in the `RestHandler` will intercept all rest calls in order to provide consistency and uniformity to all your actions. It will try/catch for major known exceptions, time your requests, add extra output on development and much more. Here are a list of the features available to you:

* Exception Handling
  * Automatic trapping of the following exceptions: `InvalidCredentials, ValidationException, EntityNotFound, RecordNotFound`
  * Automatic trapping of other exceptions to the `onAnyOtherException()` action
  * Logging automatically the exception with extra restful metadata
  * If in a `development` environment it will respond with much more information necessary for debugging both in the response object and headers
* Development Responses
  * If you are in a `development` environment it will set the following headers for you:
    * `x-current-route`
    * `x-current-routed-url`
    * `x-current-routed-namespace`
    * `x-current-event`
* Global Headers
  * The following headers are sent in each request
    * `x-response-time` : The time the request took in CF
    * `x-cached-response` : If the request is cached via event caching

The `aroundHandler()` is also smart in detecting the following outputs from a handler:

* Handler `return` results
* Setting a view or layout to render
* Explicit `renderData()` calls

### Request Context Additions

* `getResponse()`
  * Will get you the current `prc.response` object, if the object doesnâ€™t exist, it will create it and set it for you
  * The core response object can be found here: `coldbox.system.web.context.Response`

## Response Object

The `Response` object is used by the developer to set into it what the response will be by the API call.  The object is located at `coldbox.system.web.context.Response`.  It also will respond to the user in a uniform format:

### Response Format

Every response is created from the internal properties in the following representation:

```javascript
{
  "error"      : getError() ? true : false,
  "messages"   : getMessages(),
  "data"       : getData(),
  "pagination" : getPagination()
};
```

{% hint style="success" %}
You can change this response by extending the response object.
{% endhint %}

### Properties

The `Response` object has the following properties you can use via their getters and setter methods.

| Property   | Type     | Default                                                                                                 | Usage                                               |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| format     | `string` | `json`                                                                                                  | The response format of the API. Defaults to `json`. |
| data       | `struct` | ---                                                                                                     | The data struct marshalled in the response          |
| pagination | `struct` | <p><code>{</code> <br>offset,<br>maxRows,<br>page,<br>totalRecords,<br>totalPages<br><code>}</code></p> | A pagination struct to return                       |

## Extending The **RestHandler**

If you would like to extend or modify the behavior of the core `RestHandler` then you will have to create your own base handler that inherits from it. Then all of your concrete handlers will inherit from your very own handler.

```javascript
// BaseHandler
component extends="coldbox.system.Resthandler"{

  // Modify it here

}

// Then make your own handlers extend from it
component extends="BaseHandler"{

}
```

## Extending The **Response** Object

The response object can be found here: `coldbox.system.web.context.Response` and the rest handler constructs it by calling the request contextâ€™s `getResponse`() method. The method verifies if there is a `prc.response` object and if it exists it returns it, else it creates a new one. So if you would like to use your very own, then just make sure that before the request you place your own response object in the `prc` scope.

Here is a simple example using a `preProcess()` interceptor. Create a simple interceptor with commandbox e.g

```javascript
coldbox create interceptor name=MyInterceptor points=preProcess
```

and add the following method:

```javascript
function preProcess( event, interceptData, rc, prc ){
  prc.response = wirebox.getInstance( "MyResponseObject" );
}
```

Don't forget to register your interceptor in `config/Coldbox.cfc:`

```javascript
        interceptors = [
            {
            class      : "interceptors.MyInterceptor",
                name       : "MyInterceptor",
                properties : {}
            }
        ];
```

Thatâ€™s it. Once that response object is in the `prc` scope, ColdBox will utilize it. Just make sure that your custom Response object satisfies the methods in the core one. If you want to modify the output of the response object a good place to do that would be in the `getDataPacket()` method of your own `MyResponseObject`. Just make sure this method will return a `struct`.
