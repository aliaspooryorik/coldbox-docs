# Core Interception Points

There are many interception points that occur during an MVC and Remote life cycle in a ColdBox application. We highly encourage you to follow our flow diagrams in our [ColdBox Overview](broken-reference) section so you can see where in the life cycle these events fire. Also remember that each event can pass a data structure that can be used in your application.
